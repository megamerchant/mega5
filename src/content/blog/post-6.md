Stereolithography is a widely used rapid prototyping technique that utilizes a UV laser to selectively cure a liquid resin layer by layer, forming a solid object. SLA is known for its high level of detail and accuracy, making it suitable for creating prototypes with intricate geometries.

### **Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)**

Selective Laser Sintering involves using a high-power laser to fuse powdered materials, such as nylon or metal, into a solid structure. SLS is ideal for producing functional prototypes and end-use parts, offering excellent mechanical properties and a wide range of material options.

### **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)**

Fused Deposition Modeling is an additive manufacturing process where a thermoplastic filament is heated and extruded layer by layer to build a three-dimensional object. FDM is widely adopted due to its affordability, ease of use, and compatibility with various materials.

### **Digital Light Processing (DLP)**

Digital Light Processing utilizes a digital light projector to cure a liquid resin, creating solid objects layer by layer. DLP offers faster print times compared to other resin-based 3D printing technologies and is suitable for producing high-resolution prototypes.

### **CNC Machining**

Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining involves the use of computer-controlled machines to remove material from a solid block, resulting in a prototype with precise dimensions and surface finish. CNC machining is preferred for creating prototypes from metal or other rigid materials.

## **Technologies Used in Rapid Prototyping**

To enhance the rapid prototyping process, startups can leverage various technologies:

### **3D Printing**

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, enables the creation of physical objects by depositing successive layers of material based on a digital model. It is a versatile technology used in various industries for prototyping and even small-scale production.
