### CNC Machining

CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining is a versatile manufacturing process widely used by hardware product-based startups. Our state-of-the-art CNC machines precisely remove material from a solid block to create intricate parts with high accuracy. With a wide selection of materials available, including metals and plastics, CNC machining offers excellent surface finish and dimensional control. Startups can rely on this process for producing functional prototypes, small-batch production, and even complex components for larger assemblies, ensuring quality and precision at every stage.
