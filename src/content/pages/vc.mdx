### Vacuum Casting

Vaccum casting is a cost-effective and versatile process for producing small series of parts with high-quality surface finish and dimensional accuracy. It involves creating silicone molds from a master pattern and then pouring liquid polyurethane or other casting resins into the molds. Vaccum casting is particularly beneficial for hardware product-based startups during the prototyping and low-volume production stages. It offers the advantages of rapid turnaround, flexibility in material selection, and the ability to replicate intricate details, providing startups with functional and visually appealing parts.

<Tabs client:load>

<Tab name="Silicone Mold Making">

Silicone mold making involves creating a master pattern, typically through 3D printing or CNC machining, and then using it to make a silicone mold. The mold is then filled with casting materials to produce multiple replicas. It is suitable for producing small series of parts with good surface finish and fine details.

</Tab>

<Tab name="Polyurethane Casting">

Polyurethane casting uses liquid polyurethane resins poured into silicone molds to create parts. It is a cost-effective method for producing prototypes and low-volume production parts with various properties, such as flexibility, rigidity, or transparency. It finds applications in industries like consumer products, medical devices, and automotive accessories.
