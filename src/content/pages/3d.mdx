<Tab name="Fused Deposition">

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a common 3D printing technique that builds parts layer by layer by extruding thermoplastic materials. It is widely used for rapid prototyping, functional testing, and low-volume production of consumer products, automotive parts, and medical devices.

</Tab>

<Tab name="Stereolithography">

Stereolithography (SLA) uses a UV laser to cure liquid resin layer by layer, creating precise and high-resolution parts. It is suitable for producing detailed prototypes, concept models, and intricate components used in automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics industries.

</Tab>

<Tab name="Selective Laser">

Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) employs a high-powered laser to selectively fuse powdered materials, such as nylon or metal, to create durable and functional parts. It finds applications in manufacturing end-use parts, tooling, and complex geometries that require high strength and heat resistance, such as in aerospace, automotive, and industrial equipment
