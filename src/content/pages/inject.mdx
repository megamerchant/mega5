### Injection Molding

Injection molding is a highly efficient and scalable manufacturing process ideal for hardware product-based startups aiming for mass production. Through this process, molten material is injected into a mold cavity, allowing for the production of complex and detailed parts. Injection molding offers advantages such as high production volumes, consistent part quality, and cost-effectiveness in large-scale manufacturing. Startups can benefit from its ability to produce parts with various materials, including thermoplastics and elastomers, meeting the demands of their product development and production goals.
