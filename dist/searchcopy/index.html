With advantages such as increased speed, precision, and efficiency, it&#39;s no surprise that drone startups are disrupting traditional industries. India, in particular, has seen a significant increase in the adoption of drones across various sectors, including agriculture, logistics, infrastructure, traffic, and media. This blog article will delve into how drone startups in India are revolutionizing traditional industries.\\n\\n## What is Drone Technology?\\n\\nDrone technology refers to devices that can fly without human intervention. Also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones have become increasingly popular in recent years due to advancements in technology. They come in various sizes, ranging from tiny ones used for aerial photography to large ones used for military surveillance and transport.\\n\\n&gt; India has a rich history of unmanned aerial vehicles dating back to ancient times. The first recorded use of a drone in India was in 1898 when a British army officer used a kite to take aerial photographs of Bangalore. Since then, drones have come a long way in India. Today, the country boasts of having several drone startups that are disrupting traditional industries.\\n\\n## By the Numbers: India&#39;s Drone Industry Growth\\n\\nThe Indian drone industry is estimated to reach $885.7 million by 2021, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%.
